##Pseudo Elements

**Pseudo-elements**
The DOM is mutable (changeable). The magic of JavaScript (which you'll probably be learning about soon) is that it allows you to modify the DOM on the fly, effectively changing the way a live site renders.

CSS can also mutate the DOM using something called a pseudo-element. A pseudo-element is an element that is actually created with CSS and then rendered like a normal element
