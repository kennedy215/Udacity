#Strategy 2 Clearing

##Description

By default, line boxes clear out space for float elements. **"Clear,"** in this case, means that they move out of the way for floats. You can control how siblings interact with floats with clear.

**clear: left** indicates that the top of the element must be below any left floated elements that appear before this one in the document.

**clear: right** acts the same, but with right floated elements. clear: none means that there are no restrictions; this is the default value.

**clear: both**  is interesting - it indicates that the element must be below any floated elements that appear earlier in the document.
